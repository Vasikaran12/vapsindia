const about = "\tVoluntary Association for Peoples Service (VAPS)  is a development organization with extensive experience in empowering marginalized and vulnerable communities. Its operations began in 1999 and over the past two decades, VAPS has tackled pressing societal issues such as gender equality, local farming, technology transfer, women in the unorganized sector, women's health and sanitation, local economic development, and livelihoods. \n\n\tVAPS firmly believes in the power of gender-focused approaches to promote justice and equality. Therefore, it adopts an inclusive approach to support underprivileged women, helping them become economically self-sufficient and socially empowered. VAPS collaborates with the Indian government and other development partners to provide training in various areas, including better farming practices, enterprise development, up skilling and re skilling self-dignity, leadership, power, and motivation. \n\n\tVAPS has also undertaken Holistic Rural Development (HRD) projects in backward/inspirational districts. These projects focus on women's sanitation and infrastructure, the psychological well-being of girl children, skill training, employment creation, setting up microenterprises, renovating ponds and water bodies, providing drinking water arrangements, and installing solar street lights. Additionally, VAPS, in partnership with Projects & Development India Ltd. (PDIL), has established a free coaching center for SC/ST and minority community youth for competitive examinations as part of its Corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative.\n\n\tRecognizing the importance of gender-specific mechanisms for women's livelihoods, VAPS has registered a producer organization called Green Fem. This organization aims to unite nature and women, and currently consists of 300 women from the informal sector who produce eco-friendly products. Through Green Fem, many women have experienced increased income, gained awareness of their financial rights, and become empowered decision-makers within their families.\n\n\tVAPS has played an active role in enhancing local farming practices and providing extension services through the Agriclinic and Agri Business Scheme (ACABC). In collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and with the guidance and partnership of MANAGE (National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management), VAPS has conducted Agri clinic and Agribusiness programs in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry over the past two decades, contributing to local economic growth and agricultural transformation.\n\n\nGeographical Focus :\n\n\tVAPS primarily focuses on rural areas, particularly in Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, and Kerala, where it has implemented various development projects over the past two decades. These projects have had a significant impact on the lives of rural communities, especially those residing in aspirational districts including Ramnad district as designated by the NITI Ayog, the Government of India under Integrated Rural Community Development programs.";
